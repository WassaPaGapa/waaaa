All my friends are toxic, all ambitionless
So rude and always negative
I need new friends, but it's not that quick and easy
Oh, I'm drowning, let me breathe
I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oooooooooooooh!
